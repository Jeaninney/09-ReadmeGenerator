## Description: 
This project is a command-line application that creates a good README file by answering a few prompts. It utilizes fs for writing the file, util to promisify the writing of the file and inquirer to ask the questions. In fact, the README for this project was created with this application. The README that is created is stored in the 'generated' file to keep it separate from this README.
